# MCPCANFirmware

this is a summer 2015 version of the firmware I developed for the ABRS system.  Still incomplete.  Further development has been performed but not posted here for ABRS security reasons...

ANYONE looking to develop a CAN bus using MCP2515, MCP25625, or maybe some others, feel free to email me with questions at samnel42@gmail.com.  Getting started can be a REAL pain.
